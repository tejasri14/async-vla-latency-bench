# Stage 1 — Broad Exploratory Screen: OOD × Inference Delay in π0.5 on LIBERO-Plus

## 0. Purpose

**Primary question**

> **Which kinds of distribution shift become especially harmful under inference delay, and does that depend on the behavioral demands of the manipulation task?**

Stage 1 is an **exploratory screen**, not the final confirmatory experiment. It evaluates all seven official LIBERO-Plus perturbation families on three preselected base tasks chosen to represent three different task-demand groups.

The screen is intentionally broad and low-replication. Its purpose is to identify candidate **OOD × delay interactions** for higher-replication follow-up.

Do **not** select or change tasks, perturbation variants, delay settings, metrics, or selection criteria after looking at Stage 1 outcomes.

---

## 0A. Canonical terminology

Use these exact display labels in generated tables, plots, and paper text:

**Task-demand groups**

```text
Single-stage transport
Articulated/contact-rich
Multi-stage/sequential
```

**Perturbation-mechanism groups**

```text
Trajectory adaptation
Perceptual localization
Appearance invariance
Semantic grounding
```

Machine-readable snake-case keys may be used internally, but every human-facing output must map back to these display labels.

---

## 1. Policy and execution methods

### Policy

Use exactly:

```text
lerobot/pi05_libero_finetuned
```

The LeRobot checkpoint is trained on `HuggingFaceVLA/libero`, and the documented
default LeRobot LIBERO evaluation uses `n_action_steps=10`. This benchmark's
revised, frozen evaluation setting is:

```text
policy.n_action_steps = 25
```

Keep `n_action_steps=25` for Stage 1.

### Execution methods

Run exactly two asynchronous execution methods:

```text
naive_async
rtc
```

Do not include blocking execution in the Stage 1 factorial. Blocking/ideal runs may be retained as historical reference but are not part of the primary Stage 1 interaction analysis.

---

## 2. Task-demand taxonomy

The following taxonomy is **our experimental taxonomy**, not an official LIBERO taxonomy.

Use these labels exactly in logs, plots, and paper drafts.

| `task_group` | Meaning | Selected base task |
|---|---|---|
| `single_stage_transport` | A relatively short pick-and-place behavior dominated by transport between grasp and placement | Pick up the black bowl from table center and place it on the plate |
| `articulated_contact_rich` | Manipulation in which successful contact/alignment with an articulated object is central | Open the middle drawer of the cabinet |
| `multi_stage_sequential` | A task requiring multiple ordered subgoals whose errors can propagate across stages | Turn on the stove and put the moka pot on it |

### Important terminology

Do **not** call `single_stage_transport` a “coarse-motion task.” Pick-and-place still contains precise grasp and placement phases.

Do **not** claim these three groups are a standard literature taxonomy. In the paper, describe them as:

> “We stratify tasks by behavioral demand into single-stage transport, articulated/contact-rich manipulation, and multi-stage sequential manipulation.”

---

## 3. Exact base tasks

LIBERO's task API is zero-indexed: `task_suite.get_task(task_id)`.

Use these three base tasks exactly:

| `task_key` | `suite` | Standard LIBERO `task_id` | Exact LIBERO task name | `task_group` |
|---|---:|---:|---|---|
| `spatial_transport` | `libero_spatial` | **2** | `pick_up_the_black_bowl_from_table_center_and_place_it_on_the_plate` | `single_stage_transport` |
| `goal_drawer` | `libero_goal` | **0** | `open_the_middle_drawer_of_the_cabinet` | `articulated_contact_rich` |
| `long_stove_moka` | `libero_10` | **2** | `KITCHEN_SCENE3_turn_on_the_stove_and_put_the_moka_pot_on_it` | `multi_stage_sequential` |

### Required pre-run assertion

Before running any episodes:

```python
assert task_suite.get_task(task_id).name == EXPECTED_TASK_NAME
```

for all three base tasks.

### Relationship to earlier experiments

These are the **Stage 1 screening tasks defined here**. Do not silently substitute earlier preliminary task IDs. If historical runs used another task index, keep those runs separate and label them as prior/preliminary data.

---

## 4. Perturbation taxonomy

LIBERO-Plus defines seven official perturbation dimensions. We preserve those official perturbation labels and add a second, internal mechanism grouping.

| `perturbation_key` | Official LIBERO-Plus category | Internal `mechanism_group` | Interpretation used in this paper |
|---|---|---|---|
| `object_layout` | `Objects Layout` | `trajectory_adaptation` | Target displacement / confounding-object changes alter task geometry and can require a different trajectory |
| `robot_initial_state` | `Robot Initial States` | `trajectory_adaptation` | A changed manipulator start pose requires adaptation from a different configuration |
| `camera_viewpoint` | `Camera Viewpoints` | `perceptual_localization` | Camera position/orientation/FOV changes affect visual localization and spatial interpretation |
| `sensor_noise` | `Sensor Noise` | `perceptual_localization` | Image degradation stresses reliable state/object localization from observations |
| `light_conditions` | `Light Conditions` | `appearance_invariance` | Illumination changes should ideally preserve the underlying task geometry |
| `background_textures` | `Background Textures` | `appearance_invariance` | Scene/surface appearance changes should ideally not require a different control objective |
| `language_instructions` | `Language Instructions` | `semantic_grounding` | Instruction rewriting stresses language-conditioned task grounding |

### Exact mechanism groups

Use only these four internal labels:

```text
trajectory_adaptation
perceptual_localization
appearance_invariance
semantic_grounding
```

### Paper wording

Use:

> “We organize the seven official LIBERO-Plus perturbation families into four mechanism-oriented groups: trajectory adaptation, perceptual localization, appearance invariance, and semantic grounding.”

Immediately clarify:

> “These mechanism groups are an analysis taxonomy introduced for this study; the underlying seven perturbation dimensions are defined by LIBERO-Plus.”

## 5. Exactly which LIBERO-Plus variant to run

LIBERO-Plus contains many variants of each base task within each perturbation family. Stage 1 uses **one preselected OOD variant per `(base task, perturbation family)`**, giving 21 OOD task variants.

### Do not hand-pick variants

Variant selection must be deterministic and outcome-independent.

Use the official:

```text
libero/libero/benchmark/task_classification.json
```

The file contains:

```text
id
name
category
difficulty_level
```

for LIBERO-Plus tasks.

### Deterministic selection rule

For each of the 3 base tasks and each of the 7 official perturbation categories:

1. Filter entries in the matching suite whose `name` starts with the exact base-task name.
2. Filter to the exact official perturbation `category`.
3. Prefer entries with `difficulty_level == 2`.
4. If multiple level-2 entries exist, select the entry with the **smallest official `id`**.
5. If no level-2 entry exists:
   - select the entry minimizing `abs(difficulty_level - 2)`;
   - break ties using the smallest official `id`.
6. Freeze the resulting 21 variants **before any Stage 1 policy outcomes are inspected**.
7. Save the resolved mapping to:

```text
stage1_resolved_variants.csv
```

### Why level 2?

Stage 1 is intended to test nontrivial but non-extreme OOD shifts. Selecting the first deterministic moderate-difficulty variant avoids choosing variants based on π0.5 outcomes.

### LIBERO-Plus ID convention

Record **both**:

```text
classification_id
api_task_index
```

The official `task_classification.json` uses an `id` field, while the benchmark API indexes tasks with zero-based `get_task(i)`.

Do not assume the conversion silently. Resolve and verify it.

For the current official repository ordering, test:

```python
candidate_api_index = classification_id - 1
assert plus_suite.get_task(candidate_api_index).name == variant_name
```

If this assertion fails, determine the index by exact name lookup:

```python
names = plus_suite.get_task_names()
api_task_index = names.index(variant_name)
assert plus_suite.get_task(api_task_index).name == variant_name
```

The **exact task name is the canonical identifier** for Stage 1.

## 5A. Dependency on Stage 0 latency calibration

Before Stage 1, run [`STAGE_0_LATENCY_CALIBRATION.md`](STAGE_0_LATENCY_CALIBRATION.md).

Stage 0 uses **ID only** to select one frozen high-delay value `d*` from the
accepted `+100`, `+200`, `+300`, and `+400 ms` calibration candidates.

Stage 1 then **does test OOD under latency**: every one of the 21 selected LIBERO-Plus OOD variants is evaluated at both **Native** and **Native + d*** under both **Naive async** and **RTC**.

The selected value must be loaded from:

```text
selected_high_delay.json
```

Do not select or modify `d*` using OOD outcomes.

---

## 6. Delay conditions

Use exactly two delay conditions.

### `low`

```text
delay_condition = low
added_delay_ms = 0
```

This means **native inference latency**. It does not mean zero request latency.

### `high`

```text
delay_condition = high
added_delay_ms = d*
```

`d*` must be chosen using **ID-only calibration**, before examining LIBERO-Plus OOD outcomes.

### Calibration rule for `d*`

Test candidate added delays:

```text
100 ms
200 ms
300 ms
400 ms
```

using the three standard LIBERO base tasks and both execution methods.

Choose **one common `d*` for the entire Stage 1 screen** satisfying, as closely as possible:

1. delay causes visible degradation relative to native;
2. performance is not driven to floor across most task/method cells;
3. the same `d*` is used for every task, perturbation family, and method.

Prefer the smallest candidate that creates a useful separation without widespread saturation.

Once selected:

```text
HIGH_DELAY_MS = d*
```

is frozen.

Do **not**:
- use a delay outside the accepted Stage 0 calibration grid;
- choose a different high delay for RTC and naive async;
- choose a different high delay for each task;
- recalibrate using OOD outcomes.

Log both wall-clock delay in milliseconds and effective logical delay in control steps.

---

## 7. Stage 1 factorial

### Factors

```text
task_group:
    3 levels

perturbation:
    7 OOD families + shared ID control

delay_condition:
    low
    high

execution_method:
    naive_async
    rtc

seed:
    5 exploratory seeds
```

Use the same five seed values in every condition.

Recommended frozen seeds:

```text
seed = 0
seed = 1
seed = 2
seed = 3
seed = 4
```

If the existing harness requires another seed convention, choose five fixed seeds before running and record them here. Do not change seeds by condition.

### OOD episodes

```text
3 tasks
× 7 perturbations
× 2 delays
× 2 execution methods
× 5 seeds
= 420 OOD episodes
```

### Shared ID controls

The same ID condition is reused across all seven perturbations:

```text
3 tasks
× 2 delays
× 2 execution methods
× 5 seeds
= 60 ID episodes
```

Stage 0 provides the 24 low/high ID controls for seeds `0` and `1` when all
configuration and provenance fields match. Stage 1 must add the corresponding
36 ID controls for seeds `2`, `3`, and `4`:

```text
3 tasks × 2 delays × 2 methods × 3 additional seeds
= 36 new ID episodes
```

### Total Stage 1 budget

```text
420 OOD + 60 ID = 480 episodes
```

Expected new execution after valid Stage 0 reuse:

```text
420 new OOD + 36 new ID = 456 new episodes
24 reused Stage 0 ID + 456 new = 480 analysis episodes
```

Do **not** rerun ID separately for each perturbation family.

---

## 7A. Complete experiment table
This section enumerates the **entire Stage 1 run plan** using the same display terminology as the analysis taxonomy.

- **96 unique condition blocks**
- **5 fixed seeds per condition** (`0`, `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`)
- **480 total episodes**
- ID controls are shared across perturbation families and are therefore listed only once per task × method × delay.
- For OOD rows, the exact LIBERO-Plus `classification_id`, `api_task_index`, and `variant_name` are filled from `stage1_resolved_variants.csv` before execution.

### 7A.2 Episode-level execution manifest generation — all 480 planned episodes

Materialize the episode-level manifest by expanding every one of the 96 condition rows above over the frozen seed set:

```text
0, 1, 2, 3, 4
```

For each condition row, emit five episode rows in ascending seed order. Assign `exp_id` sequentially from `E001` through `E480` after expansion. The generated manifest must contain exactly:

```text
96 condition blocks × 5 seeds = 480 episode rows
60 ID rows
420 OOD rows
```

Required expansion logic:

```python
SEEDS = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]

episodes = []
for condition in condition_rows:  # the frozen 96-row matrix in Section 7A.1
    for seed in SEEDS:
        episodes.append({**condition, "seed": seed})

assert len(episodes) == 480
assert sum(row["scene"] == "ID" for row in episodes) == 60
assert sum(row["scene"] == "OOD" for row in episodes) == 420
assert sorted(set(row["seed"] for row in episodes)) == SEEDS

for index, row in enumerate(episodes, start=1):
    row["exp_id"] = f"E{index:03d}"
```

Save the materialized result as `stage1_manifest.csv`. Do not generate seeds conditionally or omit failed seed-condition pairs from the manifest. The exact OOD variant fields still come from the frozen `stage1_resolved_variants.csv`.

### 7A.3 Canonical display terms for all generated outputs
Every plot/table generator should map machine keys to the following display labels:

| Machine key | Display label |
|---|---|
| `single_stage_transport` | **Single-stage transport** |
| `articulated_contact_rich` | **Articulated/contact-rich** |
| `multi_stage_sequential` | **Multi-stage/sequential** |
| `trajectory_adaptation` | **Trajectory adaptation** |
| `perceptual_localization` | **Perceptual localization** |
| `appearance_invariance` | **Appearance invariance** |
| `semantic_grounding` | **Semantic grounding** |
| `object_layout` | **Object layout** |
| `robot_initial_state` | **Robot initial state** |
| `camera_viewpoint` | **Camera viewpoint** |
| `sensor_noise` | **Sensor noise** |
| `light_conditions` | **Lighting** |
| `background_textures` | **Background texture** |
| `language_instructions` | **Language instruction** |
| `naive_async` | **Naive async** |
| `rtc` | **RTC** |
| `low` | **Native** |
| `high` | **Native + d*** |

## 8. Required run manifest

Create one row per episode in:

```text
stage1_manifest.csv
```

Required columns:

```text
run_id
git_sha
model_revision
task_key
suite
base_task_id
base_task_name
task_group

scene_condition              # id | ood
perturbation_key             # id | object_layout | ...
official_category            # ID | official LIBERO-Plus category
mechanism_group              # id | one of the four internal groups
classification_id            # null for ID
api_task_index               # standard task id for ID; resolved plus index for OOD
variant_name                 # exact task/environment name

added_delay_ms
seed
n_action_steps

output_path
status                       # pending | running | complete | invalid
invalid_reason
```

### Run ID format

Use:

```text
{task_key}__{scene_condition}__{perturbation_key}__{execution_method}__{delay_condition}__s{seed}
```

Example:

```text
goal_drawer__ood__camera_viewpoint__rtc__high__s1
```

---

## 9. Required episode-level observations

Create:

```text
stage1_episode_results.csv
```

with one row per completed episode.

### Identity columns

```text
run_id
task_key
suite
base_task_id
task_group
scene_condition
perturbation_key
official_category
mechanism_group
variant_name
classification_id
api_task_index

```

### Outcome columns

```text

episode_steps
completion_fraction           # if available; otherwise null
failure_mode                  # taxonomy below

```

### Queue / execution columns

```text
queue_occupancy_mean
queue_occupancy_p95
underrun_count
hold_count
discard_count
num_policy_requests
```

Keep `hold_count` and `underrun_count` separate. Do not count intentional blocking/hold semantics as queue underruns.

### Action-continuity columns

```text
action_delta_mean
action_accel_mean
action_jerk_mean
```

If these are vector-valued internally, aggregate using the same norm convention across every episode and document the norm once.

### Compute columns

```text
wall_clock_episode_s
gpu_id
gpu_peak_memory_mb
```

---

## 10. Failure-mode taxonomy

Use a small fixed taxonomy. Do not invent a new label for every episode.

```text
success
perception_localization
approach_alignment
grasp_failure
contact_execution
trajectory_recovery
wrong_subgoal_or_semantics
sequential_error_accumulation
timeout
other
```

### Annotation rule

`failure_mode` is descriptive secondary analysis, not the primary outcome.

If failure cannot be assigned confidently:

```text
failure_mode = other
```

and add a short factual `failure_notes`.

Do not infer internal model reasoning from the video.

---

## 11. Primary Stage 1 statistic

For each task × perturbation × execution method, compute success rate in four cells:

```text
ID, low
ID, high
OOD, low
OOD, high
```

Define:

```text
I = [S(OOD, high) - S(OOD, low)]
    - [S(ID, high) - S(ID, low)]
```

Call `I`:

```text
OOD × delay interaction
```

### Interpretation

```text
I < 0
```

means the OOD perturbation makes the policy **less tolerant to delay** than the corresponding ID task.

```text
I ≈ 0
```

means the delay penalty is approximately unchanged by that OOD shift.

```text
I > 0
```

means delay is less damaging under that OOD condition; treat this cautiously, especially with only five exploratory seeds.

### Stage 1 wording

Do not describe a five-seed exploratory cell as statistically significant without an appropriate prespecified analysis and uncertainty estimate.

Use:

```text
candidate interaction
exploratory interaction estimate
screening result
candidate amplification of delay sensitivity
```

Do not use:

```text
statistically significant interaction
proves
establishes
```

## 12. Tables to generate immediately

Every completed run should feed the following tables automatically.

### Table A — Coverage / completion

One row per task × perturbation.

| task group | task | perturbation | mechanism group | intended episodes | completed | invalid |
|---|---|---|---|---:|---:|---:|

Purpose: detect missing cells before interpretation.

---

### Table B — Four-cell success table

One row per:

```text
task × perturbation × execution method
```

Columns:

| task group | perturbation | mechanism group | method | ID-low | ID-high | OOD-low | OOD-high | `I` |
|---|---|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|

This is the **main quick-read Stage 1 table**.

---

### Table C — Perturbation-family summary

Pool descriptively over the three tasks, but retain task-level rows elsewhere.

| perturbation | mechanism group | method | ID delay drop | OOD delay drop | pooled `I` | OOD-low success |
|---|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|

Definitions:

```text
ID delay drop  = S(ID, high)  - S(ID, low)
OOD delay drop = S(OOD, high) - S(OOD, low)
pooled I       = OOD delay drop - ID delay drop
```

---

### Table D — Mechanism-group summary

| mechanism group | perturbations included | method | mean/pooled `I` | interpretation |
|---|---|---|---:|---|
| trajectory adaptation | object layout; robot initial state | ... | ... | ... |
| perceptual localization | camera viewpoint; sensor noise | ... | ... | ... |
| appearance invariance | light conditions; background textures | ... | ... | ... |
| semantic grounding | language instructions | ... | ... | ... |

Do not overinterpret the semantic-grounding group: it contains only one perturbation family.

---

### Table E — Task-demand summary

| task group | method | mean/pooled `I` across perturbations | strongest perturbation | weakest perturbation |
|---|---|---:|---|---|
| single-stage transport | ... | ... | ... | ... |
| articulated/contact-rich | ... | ... | ... | ... |
| multi-stage/sequential | ... | ... | ... | ... |

This table directly addresses whether delay/OOD interaction depends on behavioral demand.

---

### Table F — Method comparison

| task group | perturbation | `I_naive` | `I_rtc` | RTC − naive interaction difference | ranking change? |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---|

`ranking change? = yes` if the preferred method under ID/high differs from the preferred method under OOD/high.

---

### Table G — Freshness diagnostics

| task group | perturbation | method | delay | success | mean action age | p95 action age | p95 queue occupancy | underruns |
|---|---|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|

Use this as mechanism analysis. It is **not** the headline contribution.

---

## 13. Plots to generate immediately

Generate all plots from the episode-level CSV. Never manually copy numbers.

### Plot 1 — OOD × delay interaction heatmap

**Rows**

```text
3 task-demand groups
```

**Columns**

```text
7 perturbation families
```

**Cell value**

```text
I
```

Create one heatmap for:

```text
naive_async
```

and one for:

```text
rtc
```

This should be the fastest visual for identifying candidate interactions.

---

### Plot 2 — Four-cell interaction plot

For each perturbation family:

- x-axis: `low`, `high`
- y-axis: success rate
- line 1: `ID`
- line 2: `OOD`

Facet by:

```text
task_group × execution_method
```

Interpretation:

> Non-parallel ID and OOD lines indicate a candidate OOD × delay interaction.

---

### Plot 3 — Perturbation-family interaction ranking

For each method, rank the seven perturbations by pooled `I`.

- x-axis: perturbation family
- y-axis: `I`
- horizontal line at `0`

More-negative values indicate stronger candidate amplification of delay sensitivity.

---

### Plot 4 — Mechanism-group interaction summary

Aggregate the perturbation-level estimates into:

```text
trajectory adaptation
perceptual localization
appearance invariance
semantic grounding
```

Plot `I` by mechanism group and execution method.

Label this **exploratory/descriptive**.

---

### Plot 5 — Behavioral-demand interaction summary

- x-axis: task group
- y-axis: `I`
- separate markers/lines: perturbation families
- facet by execution method

This answers:

> Does the same perturbation interact differently with delay depending on task behavioral demand?

---

### Plot 6 — Action age versus outcome

Episode-level:

- x-axis: `action_age_p95_ms`
- y-axis: success/failure
- shape/facet: task group
- facet or annotation: perturbation family

Use only as explanatory evidence for temporal freshness.

---

```

---

## 15. Predefined rule for choosing confirmatory conditions

This rule must be frozen **before Stage 1 results are examined**.

### Eligibility

A perturbation family is eligible for confirmation only if, pooled over the three task groups and both methods:

```text
OOD-low success >= 25%
```

This prevents selecting a perturbation that already fails almost completely without added delay.

Also require:

```text
ID-low success >= 50%
```

for the relevant task/method subset used to support the claim.

### Ranking

Among eligible perturbation families:

1. rank by pooled `I`, from most negative to most positive;
2. select the **two most-negative perturbation families** as the primary confirmatory candidates;
3. if a third family has a qualitatively different mechanism group and comparable `I`, retain it as an optional third candidate.

### Behavioral-demand follow-up

For each selected perturbation family, identify the task-demand group with the most negative task-level `I`.

This determines which task × perturbation combinations receive additional seeds.

### Important

The confirmation stage uses **new seeds**.

Do not simply count the original five Stage 1 seeds as if the hypothesis had been specified before seeing them. Report Stage 1 as exploratory and the additional seeds as confirmatory.

---

## 16. What counts as an interesting Stage 1 result

### Strong candidate result

Any of the following is potentially publishable if it replicates:

1. **Static OOD robustness does not predict delayed OOD robustness.**
2. A perturbation with modest native-latency degradation causes a much larger degradation under delay.
3. The OOD × delay interaction differs systematically by perturbation mechanism.
4. The same perturbation interacts differently with delay across behavioral-demand groups.
5. RTC and naive async change ranking under OOD + delay.
6. An execution method that looks robust on ID tasks does not remain robust under particular OOD shifts.

### Weak result

This alone is insufficient:

> “OOD hurts, delay hurts, and OOD plus delay hurts more.”

The paper needs a nontrivial interaction, taxonomy-dependent pattern, method-ranking effect, or failure of static robustness to predict delayed robustness.

---

## 17. Paper verbiage

### Experimental design

Use:

> “We conduct a broad exploratory screen across all seven LIBERO-Plus perturbation families. To separate the source of distribution shift from the behavioral demands of the underlying manipulation problem, we analyze perturbations along two axes: the official LIBERO-Plus perturbation dimension and an internal mechanism-oriented grouping, while stratifying base tasks into single-stage transport, articulated/contact-rich, and multi-stage sequential manipulation.”

### Main scientific question

Use:

> “Which kinds of distribution shift reduce a VLA policy’s tolerance to inference delay, and under which behavioral demands?”

### Interaction framing

Use:

> “We test whether distribution shift changes the marginal effect of inference delay, rather than merely measuring the independent degradation caused by OOD inputs and latency.”

### Stage 1 status

Use:

> “Stage 1 is a low-budget exploratory sweep used to identify candidate interactions. We report the complete sweep, including null results, and evaluate selected candidate effects on additional held-out seeds.”

### Avoid

Do not write:

```text
We tried all perturbations and selected the interesting ones.
```

Do write:

```text
We used a predefined exploratory-to-confirmatory protocol:
a broad low-budget screen followed by higher-replication evaluation of
candidate interactions selected using a frozen criterion.
```

### Source-backed facts used here

- Standard LIBERO exposes the three selected base tasks at zero-based indices:
  - `libero_spatial:2`
  - `libero_goal:0`
  - `libero_10:2`
- LIBERO-Plus defines seven perturbation dimensions:
  - Objects Layout
  - Camera Viewpoints
  - Robot Initial States
  - Language Instructions
  - Light Conditions
  - Background Textures
  - Sensor Noise
- LIBERO-Plus provides `task_classification.json` mapping task IDs to perturbation categories and difficulty levels.
- The official LIBERO-Plus benchmark implementation contains thousands of perturbed tasks per suite and retrieves tasks using zero-based `get_task(i)`.
- The LeRobot π0.5 LIBERO checkpoint is trained using `HuggingFaceVLA/libero`. This benchmark uses the frozen revised evaluation setting `n_action_steps=25`; this is a disclosed deviation from the documented default evaluation setting of 10.

POLICY:
    lerobot/pi05_libero_finetuned

N_ACTION_STEPS:
    25

TASKS:
    libero_spatial:2
        -> single_stage_transport
    libero_goal:0
        -> articulated_contact_rich
    libero_10:2
        -> multi_stage_sequential

PERTURBATIONS:
    Objects Layout
        -> trajectory_adaptation
    Robot Initial States
        -> trajectory_adaptation
    Camera Viewpoints
        -> perceptual_localization
    Sensor Noise
        -> perceptual_localization
    Light Conditions
        -> appearance_invariance
    Background Textures
        -> appearance_invariance
    Language Instructions
        -> semantic_grounding

VARIANT RULE:
    difficulty_level closest to 2
    -> lowest official id as tie-break
    -> freeze before outcomes

METHODS:
    naive_async
    rtc

DELAYS:
    low  = native
    high = native + frozen ID-calibrated d*

SEEDS:
    5 fixed exploratory seeds: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

OOD EPISODES:
    420

SHARED ID EPISODES:
    60

TOTAL:
    480

PRIMARY STATISTIC:
    I = [S(OOD,high)-S(OOD,low)]
        - [S(ID,high)-S(ID,low)]

PRIMARY INTERPRETATION:
    I < 0 => candidate evidence that OOD reduces delay tolerance

STAGE:
    exploratory
